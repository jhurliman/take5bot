## 🔧 Configuration

### Enhanced Training Settings for Competitive Performance
```python
# Optimized for competitive bot training
collector_env_num = 4         # increased for better data collection
n_episode = 8                 # restored for proper learning
evaluator_env_num = 2         # increased for better evaluation
num_simulations = 50          # restored for better MCTS
update_per_collect = 100      # restored for proper learning
batch_size = 256              # balanced for CPU vs learning
max_env_step = 200000         # full training for competitive performance
reanalyze_ratio = 0.25        # enabled for better learning
cuda = True                   # enabled for performance
```

### Environment Specs
- **Observation Space**: 253-dimensional vector (enhanced with penalty values)
  - Elements 0-103: Hand presence (binary)
  - Elements 104-207: Hand penalties (normalized)
  - Elements 208-227: Row card numbers (normalized)
  - Elements 228-247: Row card penalties (normalized)
  - Elements 248-251: Row penalty totals (normalized)
  - Element 252: Player penalty pile (normalized)
- **Action Space**: 108 actions (104 cards + 4 row choices)

### Enhanced Observation Benefits
- **Direct Penalty Values**: Model sees card penalty values directly
- **Faster Learning**: No need to learn penalty rules through trial and error
- **Better Strategy**: Can make informed decisions based on penalty costs
- **Human-like Information**: Similar to how humans see bull symbols on cards

## 📊 Monitoring & Debugging

### Freeze Detection System
- **Threshold**: 3 minutes without activity = potential freeze
- **Monitoring**: Background thread tracks system resources
- **Logging**: Detailed logs in `training_debug/`

### Key Metrics Tracked
- Training iterations and timing
- System resource usage (CPU, memory)
- Environment interactions
- Model forward passes
- MCTS search operations

### Log Files Structure

AI RECOMMENDATION
================
AI recommends playing card 23
Confidence: 85.3%
High confidence - this appears to be a strong move
This card can be played safely without taking a row
```

## 🛠️ Development Tools

### Quick Commands
```bash
# Start training with monitoring
python train_monitored.py

# Check training status
python check_training.py

# Monitor continuously
python simple_monitor.py --continuous

# Play against AI
python play_take5.py

# Generate training plots

```

### Debugging Workflow
1. **Start**: `python train_monitored.py`
2. **Monitor**: `python simple_monitor.py --continuous`
3. **Debug**: Check logs in `training_debug/`
4. **Analyze**: `python check_training.py`

## 📈 Training Progress Indicators

### Early Stage (0-10K steps)
- High loss values, random-looking policy
- Negative rewards (high penalties)
- No strategic awareness

### Mid Stage (10K-30K steps)
- Loss starts decreasing
- Policy becomes more consistent
- Basic tactical awareness emerges

### Late Stage (30K+ steps)
- Loss stabilizes
- Strategic play emerges
- Rewards approach optimal levels

## 🚨 Known Issues & Solutions

### Training Freezes
- **Symptom**: No activity for >3 minutes
- **Detection**: Automatic freeze monitoring
- **Investigation**: Check `training_debug/` logs
- **Mitigation**: Restart with `python train_monitored.py`

### Environment Issues (Fixed)
- ✅ `seed()` method now accepts `dynamic_seed` parameter
- ✅ Added `timestep` tracking to observations
- ✅ Improved simultaneous/sequential action handling

### Performance Bottlenecks
- **CPU Training**: 6-12 hours vs 2-3 hours on GPU
- **Memory**: Reduced batch size to 128
- **Parallelism**: Limited to 2 collectors, 1 evaluator
