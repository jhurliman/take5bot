# Take 5 MuZero Bot - Project Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements a MuZero-based AI agent for the Take 5 card game using the LightZero framework. The system includes comprehensive training monitoring, debugging tools, and an interactive gameplay interface.

## 🚀 Current Status

### Training Status
- **Issue**: Training appears to freeze/stall after a few hours on CPU-only MacBook Pro

- **Solution**: Comprehensive monitoring and debugging tools implemented

### What's Working
- ✅ Complete Take 5 game implementation with OpenSpiel integration
- ✅ MuZero policy configured for CPU training
- ✅ Comprehensive monitoring and debugging suite
- ✅ Interactive gameplay interface ready
- ✅ Environment fixes for seed() method and action handling

### What's Not Working
- ❌ Training freezes without checkpoints (under investigation)
- ❌ No GPU acceleration available on current hardware

## 🔧 Configuration

### Optimized CPU Training Settings
```python
# Reduced for CPU performance
collector_env_num = 2         # (was 8)
evaluator_env_num = 1         # (was 3)
num_simulations = 25          # (was 50)
batch_size = 128              # (was 512)
max_env_step = 50000          # (was 200000)
cuda = False                  # CPU only
```

### Environment Specs
- **Observation Space**: 124-dimensional vector (104 hand + 20 table state)
- **Action Space**: 108 actions (104 cards + 4 row choices)
- **Game Rules**: Standard Take 5 with penalty minimization

## 📊 Monitoring & Debugging

### Freeze Detection System
- **Threshold**: 3 minutes without activity = potential freeze
- **Monitoring**: Background thread tracks system resources
- **Logging**: Detailed logs in `training_debug/`

### Key Metrics Tracked
- Training iterations and timing
- System resource usage (CPU, memory)
- Environment interactions
- Model forward passes
- MCTS search operations

### Log Files Structure
```

## 🎮 Interactive Gameplay

### Usage
```bash
python play_take5.py
```

### Features
- Input current game state (hand + table rows)
- Get AI recommendations with confidence scores
- Strategic explanations for moves
- Safety analysis (safe vs risky plays)

### Example Session
```
Enter your hand: 15 23 67 89 104
Enter Row 1: 12 34
Enter Row 2: 7 45 67
Enter Row 3: 91
Enter Row 4: [empty]

AI RECOMMENDATION
================
AI recommends playing card 23
Confidence: 85.3%
High confidence - this appears to be a strong move
This card can be played safely without taking a row
```

## 🛠️ Development Tools

### Quick Commands
```bash
# Start training with monitoring
python train_monitored.py

# Check training status
python check_training.py

# Monitor continuously
python simple_monitor.py --continuous

# Play against AI
python play_take5.py

# Generate training plots
python monitor_training.py --plot
```

### Debugging Workflow
1. **Start**: `python train_monitored.py`
2. **Monitor**: `python simple_monitor.py --continuous`
3. **Debug**: Check logs in `training_debug/`
4. **Analyze**: `python check_training.py`

## 📈 Training Progress Indicators

### Early Stage (0-10K steps)
- High loss values, random-looking policy
- Negative rewards (high penalties)
- No strategic awareness

### Mid Stage (10K-30K steps)
- Loss starts decreasing
- Policy becomes more consistent
- Basic tactical awareness emerges

### Late Stage (30K+ steps)
- Loss stabilizes
- Strategic play emerges
- Rewards approach optimal levels

## 🚨 Known Issues & Solutions

### Training Freezes
- **Symptom**: No activity for >3 minutes
- **Detection**: Automatic freeze monitoring
- **Investigation**: Check `training_debug/` logs
- **Mitigation**: Restart with `python train_monitored.py`

### Environment Issues (Fixed)
- ✅ `seed()` method now accepts `dynamic_seed` parameter
- ✅ Added `timestep` tracking to observations
- ✅ Improved simultaneous/sequential action handling

### Performance Bottlenecks
- **CPU Training**: 6-12 hours vs 2-3 hours on GPU
- **Memory**: Reduced batch size to 128
- **Parallelism**: Limited to 2 collectors, 1 evaluator
